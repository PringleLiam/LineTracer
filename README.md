# LineTracer
This is an app designed for Android devices in which a user can select a song from their phone or memory device that is then converted into a basic waveform on screen which the user traces to score points. The song plays in the background and in sync with the on screen waveform. The closer the user stays to the waveform, the more points they will score.
